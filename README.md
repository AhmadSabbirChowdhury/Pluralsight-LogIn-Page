# Pluralsight-LogIn-Page

It is clone of Pluralsight Login page using HTML5 and CSS3. This login page is fully responsive. I used media queries for making
this site responsive. Here I didn't add any extra page or add any database to it.
But I've done a project with this same site and I used PHP for backend and mysql databse.
I will upload that project later.
